        Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?<br />
        Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality<br />
        Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see<br />
        I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy<br />
        Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low<br />
        Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Mama, just killed a man<br />
        Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead<br />
        Mama, life had just begun<br />
        But now I've gone and thrown it all away<br />
        Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry<br />
        If I'm not back again this time tomorrow<br />
        Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Too late, my time has come<br />
        Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time<br />
        Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go<br />
        Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth<br />
        Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows)<br />
        I don't wanna die<br />
        I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all<br />
